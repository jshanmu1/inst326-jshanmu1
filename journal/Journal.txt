Journal Entry 9/13
I am using google AI to assist with python syntax, it helped me out because I have usually only programmed in Java so I had to look up
How to write the logic I wanted to use in python. I also used google AI to search up what the function I was told to use did
because I have not heard of some of the functions. 

Week 2 Journal Entry 9/21
Me and my group mates used ChatGPT to help us brainstorm some ideas and to help us format the team project charter.
I also used Gemini when doing my excercises to either learn what the syntax for some of the problems should be or to
solve the problems that I did not know how to do. Number 30 was mostly gemini because I did not understand what the problem 
was asking me to do.
